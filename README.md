# Flappy-Birds-Copy-
Android Flappy Birds game using libGDX

There are three game states, in game state 1 : the user is playing the game, 
in game state 0 : the game is idle and waiting for user to touch the screen,
in game state 2 : user has lost the game and waiting for user to touch the screen to change the state to idle again.

In the code the bird is defined as a circle, and the obstacles are defined as rectangles, where the circle and any of the 
rectangles collapse, the game is over. 

There are four rectanges which repeat itself. The rectangles are going to the beginning after passing the screen. 

This is a practice project for learning.
